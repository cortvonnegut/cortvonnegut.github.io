        Living in the Midwest means a particular challenge in the winter. The second the temperatures start dropping, you know you're in for a challenge. Everyone begins to prepare by loading up on lotions and creams. After a few years, you start to get a routine down, and begin to have products in your arsenal at the redady before the first snow flies. 
        For me, I won't go a single winter without Neutrogena Norweigan Formula Hand Cream. 
        It's my savior for dry, cracking hands. It's got a thick balm-like texture, and it spreads easily.
        I always try to have some on hand. Having dry hands is a day ruiner for me! Anyone else? The feeling of dry skin on microfiber is pretty bad too.

        Other ideas for winter: drinking a lot of water and running a humidifier. If you've never used a humidifier while you slept, let this year be the year you start. You'll be shocked by the difference in your skin.
